This dataset, titled "Startup Investments (Crunchbase)" is a collection of data related to startup companies and their investments, sourced from the popular startup database Crunchbase. The data includes information on over 50,000 startups, along with their funding rounds, investors, and other relevant details.

The dataset contains several CSV files, each of which provides information on a different aspect of the startup investment landscape. These files include:

  Companies: This file includes information on the startups themselves, including their name, location, category, and status (e.g. closed, acquired, IPO).

  Investments: This file provides information on individual funding rounds, including the funding type, amount raised, and date of the round.

  Investors: This file contains information on the investors involved in each funding round, including their name, location, and type (e.g. angel investor, venture capital firm).

  Acquisitions: This file provides information on acquisitions of startups, including the name of the acquiring company and the date of the acquisition.

  IPOs: This file contains information on initial public offerings (IPOs) of startups, including the name of the company and the date of the IPO.

The data covers startups from around the world and includes information on funding rounds from 2007 to 2018.

The dataset can be used for a variety of purposes, including research into the startup investment landscape, analysis of trends in startup funding, and identification of potential investment opportunities. However, users should be aware that the data may be incomplete or inaccurate, as it is sourced from a crowdsourced database and may be subject to errors or omissions.

The dataset is available for download on the Kaggle platform, and users are encouraged to provide proper attribution to the original data source (Crunchbase) when using the data for their own projects.
